# Apple Watch vs Fitbit Data Analysis

## Introduction
This project provides a comparative analysis of the accuracy of health and fitness tracking data between Apple Watch and Fitbit devices. The analysis focuses on various health metrics such as heart rate, steps, calories burned, and activity intensity. The goal is to highlight the differences in accuracy between the two devices and provide insights into the strengths and weaknesses of each.

## Dataset Description
The dataset used in this project contains health and fitness metrics tracked by Apple Watch and Fitbit devices. The key columns in the dataset include:

- **age**: Age of the individual
- **gender**: Gender of the individual
- **height**: Height in centimeters
- **weight**: Weight in kilograms
- **steps**: Number of steps taken
- **heart_rate**: Heart rate in beats per minute
- **calories**: Calories burned
- **distance**: Distance covered in meters
- **entropy_heart**: Entropy related to heart rate
- **entropy_steps**: Entropy related to steps taken
- **resting_heart**: Resting heart rate in beats per minute
- **corr_heart_steps**: Correlation between heart rate and steps
- **norm_heart**: Normalized heart rate
- **intensity_karvonen**: Intensity calculated using the Karvonen method
- **device**: Device used for data collection (Apple Watch, Fitbit)
- **activity**: Activity being performed (e.g., Lying, Running)

## Visualizations
The following visualizations were generated using the data:

1. **Calories Burned by Activity**: Comparison of calories burned during various activities as tracked by Apple Watch and Fitbit.
2. **Steps vs. Distance Scatterplot**: Linear relationship between steps and distance for Apple Watch; no discernible correlation for Fitbit.
3. **Resting Heart Rate Boxplot**: Distribution of resting heart rates with outliers highlighted.
4. **Activity Intensity Treemap**: Intensity comparison using the Karvonen method.
5. **Height and Weight Histogram**: Distribution of height and weight within the dataset.

## Conclusions
The analysis indicates that the Apple Watch generally provides more accurate health and fitness tracking data compared to Fitbit. Notable differences include:

- **Calories Burned**: Apple Watch tends to report more calories burned during certain activities.
- **Steps vs. Distance**: Apple Watch shows a clear linear relationship, indicating better accuracy in distance tracking.
- **Resting Heart Rate**: Apple Watch shows fewer outliers and more consistent data.
- **Activity Intensity**: Apple Watch provides a more logical and accurate representation of activity intensity.
