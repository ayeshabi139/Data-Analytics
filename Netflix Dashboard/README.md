# Netflix Dashboard

## Overview

The **Netflix Dashboard** is an interactive, data-driven dashboard designed to provide insights into various aspects of Netflix's content library. The dashboard allows users to explore and analyze Netflix's extensive collection of movies and TV shows, focusing on key metrics such as genre distribution, content ratings, release trends, and more.

This project has been created using Tableau and consists of two key files:
